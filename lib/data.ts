    question: "I've been running a small consulting business for 3 years, making about $150k annually, but I feel completely stuck. My competitors are landing bigger clients while I'm still doing $5k projects. I don't know if I should focus on one niche, hire employees, raise my prices, or completely pivot to something else. I'm working 60-hour weeks but not growing. Everyone gives me different advice and I'm paralyzed by all the options. What should I actually focus on to break through this ceiling and scale to $500k?",
    question1: "I launched my online course business 18 months ago and I'm barely making $3k per month. I see other course creators making six figures, but I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. My content is good, I have social media followers, but sales are terrible. Should I lower my prices, create more courses, focus on affiliate marketing, build a membership site, or try something completely different? I'm running out of money and need to figure this out fast. What would you do?"

    question: "I run a wedding photography business and I'm drowning in admin work. Every week I spend 15 hours responding to inquiry emails, sending contracts back and forth, chasing down payments, posting photos to social media, and manually updating my client spreadsheet. I'm missing out on bookings because I can't respond to emails fast enough, and I'm constantly behind on social media. I want to focus on taking amazing photos, not being a secretary. Help me automate this chaos so I can actually grow my business!",
    question1: "I sell handmade jewelry online through Shopify and I'm doing about 50 orders per week, but the manual work is killing me. Every order requires me to: update my inventory spreadsheet, create a Slack message for my fulfillment team, manually generate invoices in QuickBooks, send tracking emails to customers, and follow up with review requests. It takes 20 minutes per order and I'm working 16-hour days just to keep up. I also need to post product photos across Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok but never have time. I want to scale to 200 orders per week but can't handle the workload. What should I automate first to free up my time and grow faster?"

    {
    type: "saas",
    question: "I want to build a SaaS that automatically generates social media posts from blog articles using AI. Users would paste their blog URL, and my tool would create Instagram posts, Twitter threads, and LinkedIn content automatically. I think this could save content creators hours every week. There are tools like Buffer and Hootsuite, but they don't have AI content generation. I'm thinking of charging $29/month. Is this a viable SaaS idea or should I focus on something else?",
    question1: "I'm building a SaaS for project management specifically designed for creative agencies. Users need to create projects, assign tasks to team members, track time, generate client reports, and handle invoicing. I want to use Next.js 14 with Supabase for the backend. The app needs user authentication, role-based permissions (admin, project manager, team member), file uploads for creative assets, and real-time collaboration. I'm planning to use Clerk for auth and shadcn/ui for components. How should I structure this technically and what's a realistic timeline for an MVP?"
